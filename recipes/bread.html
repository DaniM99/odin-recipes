    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A great recipe for an electric breadmaker â€“ or do it the traditional way</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500gr strong white flour</li>
        <li>2tsp salt</li>
        <li>7gr fast-action yeast</li>
        <li>3tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>300ml water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.</li>
        <li>Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.</li>
        <li>Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.</li>
        <li>Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.</li>
        <li>Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire rack</li>
    </ol>
